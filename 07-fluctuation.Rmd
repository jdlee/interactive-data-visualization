## Cycle plot
Cycle plot make comparions between months easy.  Showing bars rather than lines helps focus attenton the specitic years when the seatbelt law was enacted.

```{r, cycle-plot}
hline.df <- belts.df %>% group_by(Month) %>% summarize(m.killed = mean(belts.DriversKilled))


ggplot() +
  geom_path(data = belts.df, aes(x = Year, y = belts.DriversKilled, group = Month, color = belts.law), alpha = .6) +
  geom_hline( data = hline.df, aes(yintercept = m.killed), colour = "grey15", size = 1.5) +
  facet_grid(~Month) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())


ggplot() +
  geom_bar(data = belts.df, aes(x = Year, y = belts.DriversKilled, group = Month, fill = belts.law), alpha = .6, 
    stat = "identity") +
  geom_hline( data = hline.df, aes(yintercept = m.killed), colour = "grey15", size = 1.5) +
  facet_grid(~Month) +
  theme(axis.text.x = element_blank())

## Stacked area and line graphs
Challenges of comparing individual contributions, ease of seeing combined effect
Stream plot

"Streamgraphs are a generalization of stacked area graphs where the baseline is free. By shifting the baseline, it is possible to minimize the change in slope (or wiggle) in individual series, thereby making it easier to perceive the thickness of any given layer across the data. Byron & Wattenberg describe several streamgraph algorithms in 'Stacked Graphsâ€”Geometry & Aesthetics^[http://www.leebyron.com/else/streamgraph/]'"^[Bostock. http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/4060954]

"A steamgraph is a more aesthetically appealing version of a stacked area chart. It tries to highlight the changes in the data by placing the groups with the most variance on the edges, and the groups with the least variance towards the centre. This feature in conjunction with the centred alignment of each of the contributing areas makes it easier for the viewer to compare the contribution of any of the components across time."
