Often this promise is not kept and data overwhelms rather than informs. Well-crafted visualization can make data meaningful. This book provides principles and examples for data visualization Provides ways of addressing common challenges: remove legend (Section 11.6.3) reorder categories of a bar chart or facets Creating Tufte inspired styles (Section 6.9.1) 2.1 Seeing meaning rather than numbers Figure 2.1 shows a typical report of a medical diagnostic test. The numerical summary shows the patient’s values and the range of standard values. The information is there to show if a patient is dangerously outside the range, but a quick glance at the table might miss these indications. Even a careful reading of the table might miss warning signs, particularly if the critical information is in the trend that requires looking at a second table on another tab. Figure 2.2 shows the data relative to the high and low normal range and makes deviations much more apparent. The ghosted points show past results and roughly indicate trends. FIGURE 2.1: A typical report of a medical test makes finding deviations from the normal range difficult. FIGURE 2.2: A visualization of the same results makes the deviations pop out. 2.2 Seeing more than summary statistics The easy availability of sophisticated machine learning and statistical models makes algorithmic interpretation of data tempting. However, such interpretations can mislead, with similar outcomes produced by very different underlying data. Figure 2.3 shows four distinct sets of data. The differences are obvious when graphed. One might expect that the typical summary statistics–mean, standard deviation, and correlation–would show equally stark differences. Table 2.1 shows this is not the case. Each data set has the same summary statistics. FIGURE 2.3: The Anscombe quartet and the limits of summary statistics. TABLE 2.1: Four seemingly identical datasets that illustrate the limits of algorithmic interpretation. Data set Mean Standard deviation Correlation Set 1 7.5 2.03 0.82 Set 2 7.5 2.03 0.82 Set 3 7.5 2.03 0.82 Set 4 7.5 2.03 0.82 2.3 Purpose and audience of visualizations Explore, inform, and engage (Gelman and Unwin 2013) Target audience: yourself, peers, scientists and engineers, public (NYTimes ref) Explore: the answer is unknown and audience is likely yourself and peers involved in the research Inform: the answer is known and the audience is likely a broader audience of scientists, engineers, or manager not direclty involved in the research. Engage: the answer is known and must be communicated in an entertaining way to those who may might neet to be drawn into readin the graph and may not be familiar with conventions of scientific visualization, such as box plots. 2.4 What question to answer? 2.5 Storytelling with graphics High-level principles for communication, such as “Show don’t tell” Role of annotation in going beyond the data: direct attention and explain, as in Table ??.
