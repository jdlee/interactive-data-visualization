abstract = {This review describes recent experimental and focus group research on graphics as a method of communication about quantitative health risks. Some of the studies discussed in this review assessed effect of graphs on quantitative reasoning, others assessed effects on behavior or behavioral intentions, and still others assessed viewers' likes and dislikes. Graphical features that improve the accuracy of quantitative reasoning appear to differ from the features most likely to alter behavior or intentions. For example, graphs that make part-to-whole relationships available visually may help people attend to the relationship between the numerator (the number of people affected by a hazard) and the denominator (the entire population at risk), whereas graphs that show only the numerator appear to inflate the perceived risk and may induce risk-averse behavior. Viewers often preferred design features such as visual simplicity and familiarity that were not associated with accurate quantitative judgments. Communicators should not assume that all graphics are more intuitive than text; many of the studies found that patients' interpretations of the graphics were dependent upon expertise or instruction. Potentially useful directions for continuing research include interactions with educational level and numeracy and successful ways to communicate uncertainty about risk.},

abstract = {Of all the graphic forms used today, the scatterplot is arguably the most versatile, polymorphic, and generally useful invention in the history of statistical graphics. Its use by Galton led to the discovery of correlation and regression, and ultimately to much of present multivariate statistics. So, it is perhaps surprising that there is no one widely credited with the invention of this idea. Even more surprising is that there are few contenders for this title, and this question seems not to have been raised before. This article traces some of the developments in the history of this graphical method, the origin of the term scatterplot, the role it has played in the history of science, and some of its modern descendants. We suggest that the origin of this method can be traced to its unique advantage: the possibility to discover regularity in empirical data by smoothing and other graphic annotations to enhance visual perception.},

abstract = {Animation has been used to show trends in multi-dimensional data. This technique has recently gained new prominence for presentations, most notably with Gapminder Trendalyzer. In Trendalyzer, animation together with interesting data and an engaging presenter helps the audience understand the results of an analysis of the data. It is less clear whether trend animation is effective for analysis. This paper proposes two alternative trend visualizations that use static depictions of trends: one which shows traces of all trends overlaid simultaneously in one display and a second that uses a small multiples display to show the trend traces side-by-side. The paper evaluates the three visualizations for both analysis and presentation. Results indicate that trend animation can be challenging to use even for presentations; while it is the fastest technique for presentation and participants find it enjoyable and exciting, it does lead to many participant errors. Animation is the least effective form for analysis; both static depictions of trends are significantly faster than animation, and the small multiples display is more accurate.},

abstract = {Understanding and exploiting the abilities of the human visual system is an important part of the design of usable user interfaces and information visualizations. Designers traditionally learn qualitative rules of thumb for how to enable quick, easy, and veridical perception of their design. More recently, work in human and computer vision has produced more quantitative models of human perception, which take as input arbitrary, complex images of a design. In this article, we ask whether models of perception aid the design process, using our tool DesignEye as a working example of a perceptual tool incorporating such models. Through a series of interactions with designers and design teams, we find that the models can help, but in somewhat unexpected ways. DesignEye was capable of facilitating A/B comparisons between designs, and judgments about the quality of a design. However, overall "goodness" values were not very useful, showed signs of interfering with a natural process of trading off perceptual vs. other design issues, and would likely interfere with acceptance of a perceptual tool by professional designers. Perhaps most surprisingly, DesignEye, by providing in essence a simple visualization of the design, seemed to facilitate communication about not only perceptual aspects of design, but also about design goals and how to achieve those goals. We discuss resulting design principles for making perceptual tools useful in general. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2012 APA, all rights reserved)(journal abstract)},

Storytellers, especially online journalists, have increasingly been integrating visualizations into their narratives, in some cases allowing the visualization to function in place of a written story. In this paper, we systematically review the design space of this emerging class of visualizations. Drawing on case studies from news media to visualization research, we identify distinct genres of narrative visualization. We characterize these design differences, together with interactivity and messaging, in terms of the balance between the narrative flow intended by the author (imposed by graphical elements and the interface) and story discovery on the part of the reader (often through interactive exploration). Our framework suggests design strategies for narrative visualization, including promising under-explored approaches to journalistic storytelling and educational media.},

A few frameworks and taxonomies of Infovis interaction techniques exist, but they typically focus on low-level operations and do not address the variety of benefits interaction provides. After conducting an extensive review of Infovis systems and their interactive capabilities, we propose seven general categories of interaction techniques widely used in Infovis: 1) Select, 2) Explore, 3) Reconfigure, 4) Encode, 5) Abstract/Elaborate, 6) Filter, and 7) Connect. These categories are organized around a user's intent while interacting with a system rather than the low-level interaction techniques provided by a system. The categories can act as a framework to help discuss and evaluate interaction techniques and hopefully lay an initial foundation toward a deeper understanding and a science of interaction.},
